/**
 * SECTION:gdata-download-stream
 * @short_description: GData download stream object
 * @stability: Unstable
 * @include: gdata/gdata-download-stream.h
 *
 * #GDataDownloadStream is a #GInputStream subclass to allow downloading of files from GData services with authorization from a #GDataService under
 * the given #GDataAuthorizationDomain. If authorization is not required to perform the download, a #GDataAuthorizationDomain doesn't have to be
 * specified.
 *
 * Once a #GDataDownloadStream is instantiated with gdata_download_stream_new(), the standard #GInputStream API can be used on the stream to download
 * the file. Network communication may not actually begin until the first call to g_input_stream_read(), so having a #GDataDownloadStream around is no
 * guarantee that the file is being downloaded.
 *
 * The content type and length of the file being downloaded are made available through #GDataDownloadStream:content-type and
 * #GDataDownloadStream:content-length as soon as the appropriate data is received from the server. Connect to the
 * #GObject::notify <code type="literal">content-type</code> and <code type="literal">content-length</code> details to be notified as
 * soon as the data is available.
 *
 * The entire download operation can be cancelled using the #GCancellable instance provided to gdata_download_stream_new(), or returned by
 * gdata_download_stream_get_cancellable(). Cancelling this at any time will cause all future #GInputStream method calls to return
 * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED. If any #GInputStream methods are in the process of being called, they will be cancelled and return %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED as
 * soon as possible.
 *
 * Note that cancelling an individual method call (such as a call to g_input_stream_read()) using the #GCancellable parameter of the method will not
 * cancel the download as a whole â€” just that particular method call. In the case of g_input_stream_read(), this will cause it to successfully return
 * any data that it has in memory at the moment (up to the requested number of bytes), or return a %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED if it was blocking on receiving
 * data from the network. This is also the behaviour of g_input_stream_read() when the download operation as a whole is cancelled.
 *
 * In the case of g_input_stream_close(), the call will return immediately if network activity hasn't yet started. If it has, the network activity will
 * be cancelled, regardless of whether the call to g_input_stream_close() is cancelled. Cancelling a pending call to g_input_stream_close() (either
 * using the method's #GCancellable, or by cancelling the download stream as a whole) will cause it to stop waiting for the network activity to finish,
 * and return %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED immediately. Network activity will continue to be shut down in the background.
 *
 * If the server returns an error message (for example, if the user is not correctly authenticated/authorized or doesn't have suitable permissions to
 * download from the given URI), it will be returned as a #GDataServiceError by the first call to g_input_stream_read().

/*
 * The GDataDownloadStream can be in one of several states:
 *  1. Pre-network activity. This is the state that the stream is created in. @network_thread and @cancellable are both %NULL, and @finished is %FALSE.
 *     The stream will remain in this state until gdata_download_stream_read() or gdata_download_stream_seek() are called for the first time.
 *     @content_type and @content_length are at their default values (NULL and -1, respectively).
 *  2. Network activity. This state is entered when gdata_download_stream_read() is called for the first time.
 *     @network_thread, @buffer and @cancellable are created, while @finished remains %FALSE.
 *     As soon as the headers are downloaded, which is guaranteed to be before the first call to gdata_download_stream_read() returns, @content_type
 *     and @content_length are set from the headers. From this point onwards, they are immutable.
 *  3. Reset network activity. This state is entered only if case 3 is encountered in a call to gdata_download_stream_seek(): a seek to an offset which
 *     has already been read out of the buffer. In this state, @buffer is freed and set to %NULL, @network_thread is cancelled (then set to %NULL),
 *     and @offset is set to the seeked-to offset. @finished remains at %FALSE.
 *     When the next call to gdata_download_stream_read() is made, the download stream will go back to state 2 as if this was the first call to
 *     gdata_download_stream_read().
 *  4. Post-network activity. This state is reached once the download thread finishes downloading, due to having downloaded everything.
 *     @buffer is non-%NULL, @network_thread is non-%NULL, but meaningless; @cancellable is still a valid #GCancellable instance; and @finished is set
 *     to %TRUE. At the same time, @finished_cond is signalled.
 *     This state can be exited either by making a call to gdata_download_stream_seek(), in which case the stream will go back to state 3; or by
 *     calling gdata_download_stream_close(), in which case the stream will return errors for all operations, as the underlying %GInputStream will be
 *     marked as closed.
