/**
 * SECTION:gdata-upload-stream
 * @short_description: GData upload stream object
 * @stability: Unstable
 * @include: gdata/gdata-upload-stream.h
 *
 * #GDataUploadStream is a #GOutputStream subclass to allow uploading of files from GData services with authorization from a #GDataService under
 * the given #GDataAuthorizationDomain. If authorization is not required to perform the upload, a #GDataAuthorizationDomain doesn't have to be
 * specified.
 *
 * Once a #GDataUploadStream is instantiated with gdata_upload_stream_new(), the standard #GOutputStream API can be used on the stream to upload
 * the file. Network communication may not actually begin until the first call to g_output_stream_write(), so having a #GDataUploadStream around is no
 * guarantee that data is being uploaded.
 *
 * Uploads of a file, or a file with associated metadata (a #GDataEntry) should use #GDataUploadStream, but if you want to simply upload a single
 * #GDataEntry, use gdata_service_insert_entry() instead. #GDataUploadStream is for large streaming uploads.
 *
 * Once an upload is complete, the server's response can be retrieved from the #GDataUploadStream using gdata_upload_stream_get_response(). In order
 * for network communication to be guaranteed to have stopped (and thus the response definitely available), g_output_stream_close() must be called
 * on the #GDataUploadStream first. Otherwise, gdata_upload_stream_get_response() may return saying that the operation is still in progress.
 *
 * If the server returns an error instead of a success response, the error will be returned by g_output_stream_close() as a #GDataServiceError.
 *
 * The entire upload operation can be cancelled using the #GCancellable instance provided to gdata_upload_stream_new(), or returned by
 * gdata_upload_stream_get_cancellable(). Cancelling this at any time will cause all future #GOutputStream method calls to return
 * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED. If any #GOutputStream methods are in the process of being called, they will be cancelled and return %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED as
 * soon as possible.
 *
 * Note that cancelling an individual method call (such as a call to g_output_stream_write()) using the #GCancellable parameter of the method will not
 * cancel the upload as a whole — just that particular method call. In the case of g_output_stream_write(), this will cause it to return the number of
 * bytes it has successfully written up to the point of cancellation (up to the requested number of bytes), or return a %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED if it
 * had not managed to write any bytes to the network by that point. This is also the behaviour of g_output_stream_write() when the upload operation as
 * a whole is cancelled.
 *
 * In the case of g_output_stream_close(), the call will return immediately if network activity hasn't yet started. If it has, the network activity
 * will be cancelled, regardless of whether the call to g_output_stream_close() is cancelled. Cancelling a pending call to g_output_stream_close()
 * (either using the method's #GCancellable, or by cancelling the upload stream as a whole) will cause it to stop waiting for the network activity to
 * finish, and return %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED immediately. Network activity will continue to be shut down in the background.
 *
 * Any outstanding data is guaranteed to be written to the network successfully even if a call to g_output_stream_close() is cancelled. However, if
 * the upload stream as a whole is cancelled using #GDataUploadStream:cancellable, no more data will be sent over the network, and the network
 * connection will be closed immediately. i.e. #GDataUploadStream will do its best to instruct the server to cancel the upload and any associated
 * server-side changes of state.
 *
 * If the server returns an error message (for example, if the user is not correctly authenticated/authorized or doesn't have suitable permissions
 * to upload from the given URI), it will be returned as a #GDataServiceError by g_output_stream_close().

/*
 * We have a network thread which does all the uploading work. We send the message encoded as chunks, but cannot use the SoupMessageBody as a
 * data buffer, since it can only ever be touched by the network thread. Instead, we pass data to the network thread through a GDataBuffer, with
 * the main thread pushing it on as and when write() is called. The network thread cannot block on popping data off the buffer, as it requests fixed-
 * size chunks, and there's no way to notify it that we've reached EOF; so when it gets to popping the last chunk off the buffer, which may well be
 * smaller than its chunk size, it would block for more data and therefore hang. Consequently, the network thread instead pops as much data as it can
 * off the buffer, up to its chunk size, which is a non-blocking operation.
 *
 * The write() and close() operations on the output stream are synchronised with the network thread, so that the write() call only returns once the
 * network thread has written at least as many bytes as were passed to the write() call, and the close() call only returns once all network activity
 * has finished (including receiving the response from the server). Async versions of these calls are provided by GOutputStream.
 *
 * The number of bytes in the various buffers are recorded using:
 *  • message_bytes_outstanding: the number of bytes in the GDataBuffer which are waiting to be written to the SoupMessageBody
 *  • network_bytes_outstanding: the number of bytes which have been written to the SoupMessageBody, and are waiting to be written to the network
 *  • network_bytes_written: the total number of bytes which have been successfully written to the network
 *
 * Mutex locking order:
 *  1. response_mutex
 *  2. write_mutex
