libgdata
========

libgdata is a GLib-based library for accessing online service APIs using the
GData protocol --- most notably, Google's services. It provides APIs to access
the common Google services, and has full asynchronous support.

See the test programs in gdata/tests/ for simple examples of how to use the
code.

libgdata's API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.

Dependencies
============

 • glib-2.0 ≥ 2.31.0
 • libxml-2.0
 • gio-2.0 ≥ 2.17.3
 • libsoup-2.4 ≥ 2.37.91
 • liboauth ≥ 0.9.4
 • json-glib ≥ 0.15.0

If compiling with --enable-gnome (for GNOME support):
 • libsoup-gnome-2.4
 • gcr-base-3
 • goa-1.0 ≥ 3.2

If compiling the demos:
 • gtk+-3.0 ≥ 2.91.2

Environment variables
=====================

If the environment variable LIBGDATA_DEBUG is set to one of the following
values, libgdata will give debug output (at various levels):
 0: Output no debug messages or network logs
 1: Output debug messages, but not network logs
 2: Output debug messages and network traffic headers
 3: Output debug messages and full network traffic logs, redacting usernames,
    passwords and auth. tokens
 4: Output debug messages and full network traffic logs, and don't redact
    usernames, passwords and auth. tokens
If LIBGDATA_DEBUG is unset, no debug output will be produced.

So, to debug a program which uses libgdata, run it from a terminal with the
following command:

$ LIBGDATA_DEBUG=3 ./my-program-name &> libgdata.log

Deprecation guards
==================

If LIBGDATA_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is defined when compiling against libgdata, all
deprecated API will be removed from included headers.

Licensing
=========

libgdata is licensed under the LGPL; see COPYING.LIB for more details.
